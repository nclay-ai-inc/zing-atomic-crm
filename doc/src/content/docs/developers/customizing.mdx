Developers can customize the ZingIQ application to suit their business needs. Some of the customizations can be achieved via configuration on the `<CRM>` component, while others require changes to the source code.

## The `<CRM>` component

The entry point of the frontend application is the `src/App.tsx` file. By default, this file simply renders the `<CRM>` component, which is the root component of ZingIQ.

```tsx
import { CRM } from "@/components/atomic-crm/root/CRM";

const App = () => <CRM />;

export default App;
```

`<CRM>` accepts various props to customize the application domain and look and feel, so the `App.tsx` file is the best place to configure your CRM.

For instance, the following code snippet shows how to customize the CRM application domain-specific data.

```tsx
import { CRM } from "@/components/atomic-crm/root/CRM";

const App = () => (
    <CRM
        contactGender={[
            { value: 'male', label: 'He' },
            { value: 'female', label: 'She' },
        ]}
        companySectors={['Technology', 'Finance']}
        dealCategories={['Copywriting', 'Design']}
        dealPipelineStatuses={['won']}
        dealStages={[
            { value: 'opportunity', label: 'Opportunity' },
            { value: 'proposal-sent', label: 'Proposal Sent' },
            { value: 'won', label: 'Won' },
            { value: 'lost', label: 'Lost' },
        ]}
        noteStatuses={[
            { value: 'cold', label: 'Cold', color: '#7dbde8' },
            { value: 'warm', label: 'Warm', color: '#e8cb7d' },
            { value: 'hot', label: 'Hot', color: '#e88b7d' },
        ]}
        taskTypes={['Call', 'Email', 'Meeting']}
    />
);

export default App;
```

`<CRM>` accepts the following props:
